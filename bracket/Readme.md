My NVR needed some work. It was noisy so the

- HDD needed to be replaced with an SSD (see the xdd folder)
- The fan needed to be replaced with a silent fan and a fan controler
  - this fan controler needed a bracket to hold it in place
  - glue worked fine but this bracket works even better!

There is also a design for a base bracked to mount the NVR against the wall
this never got printed and I mounted it using 4 washers directly to the wall...
