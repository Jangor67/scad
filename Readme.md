This repository contains some home 3D designwork using OpenScad.

Since August 2023 I got a Prusa Mini 3D printer from one of my neighbors
for a fair price and also discovered [OpenScad](https://openscad.org).
This is a really nice way to model 3D objects without learning difficult
design tools. It is really fun creating practical things by just using
sphere, cube, cylinder together with some boolean operators (difference)

In this repository i maintain some practical designs to create and fix 
stuff that i encountered along my journeys. Most of them really close 
to and in my own home.

One of hem is a furnace knob since the original ones had been
severely battered by the heat caused by putting a big pan on the
furnace which also covered the knobs and causing the heat to reach
and partly melt down the existing ones...

Don't expect these designs to be perfect. Sometimes the print
works but could still be improved. Sometimes I put the future 
improvements in the notes on top of the scad files as well...

Have fun!
